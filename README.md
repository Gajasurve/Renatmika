This is a small WhatsApp bot I built for myself — to start my mornings with something peaceful and spiritual instead of random memes or social media.

* What it sends (Every day at 4 AM):
* 10 Names of Lord Vishnu
From the Shatanama Stotra (108 names of Vishnu)

Each name is shown in 2 lines:

One line in English transliteration

One line with simple meaning or thought

I read them slowly, reflect for a moment, and try to carry that energy through the day. It’s a calm and positive way to start the morning.

* Today’s Basic Panchang (Indian Calendar Info)
Before the names, the bot also shows a short daily Panchang:

Day (Vāra), Tithi, Nakshatra, Maas, Ritu, etc.

Just a small way to stay connected with time in the traditional way — like how our elders did.

*  Why I Made This
I used to wake up and check memes or random chats first thing in the morning.
Now, I get a message that brings me back to something sacred and grounding.

It’s simple:
Wake up → Check WhatsApp → Read Vishnu names → Begin the day with focus and peace.
